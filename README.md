 <header>Simple top-down shooter (with a capybara).</header>
 
 Made in pygame for my Python class.
 <ul>
  <li>Be a knight(with a gunðŸ˜³)</li>
  <li>3 whole enemies!</li>
  <li>A menacing capybara final boss</li>
  <li>Uses collision to detect when bullets hit and when the player is touched by a bad guy</li>
 </ul>

Next time I make a game in pygame(I won't be making another game with pygame) I'm definitely going to use classes for each level state instead of what I did here... But hey, it works!

# gunknight
 Simple top-down shooter (with a capybara). Made with pygame.
 
 Made in pygame for my Python class.
 -Be a knight(with a gunðŸ˜³)
 -3 whole enemies!
 -A menacing capybara final boss
 -Uses collision to detect when bullets hit and when the player is touched by a bad guy

The code is real messy. Next time I make a game in pygame(I won't be making another game with pygame) I'm definitely going to use classes for each level state instead of what I did here... But hey, it works!
